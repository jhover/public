DEVELOPMENT NOTES/CHANGELOG

*Discovered why Jun and Bo went back to low-level socket classes for networking:
.NET has no WriteObject()/ReadObject() methods able to work generically with 
streams (e.g. a NetworkStream). The behavior of the underlying TCP socket can
interfere/hang with the provided Serialize()/Deserialize() methods, although 
they *sometimes* work (e.g. if you write *two* objects into a stream, one of 
can probably be deserialized on the other end. yuk. )
