scoresite INSTALL
=================

Note that scoresite depends on argtable, an ANSI C command line 
processing library. Available at:
  http://argtable.sourceforge.net/
The latest distribution is included for convenience. 


If you don't already have argtable installed:
    make argtable
    [sudo] make argtable-install

Then, to install scoresite:
   make
   [sudo] make install

The makefile assumes the argtable include file is in /usr/local/includes, and
its lib is in /usr/local/lib. If this isn't the case, a makefile adjustment will
be necessary.
