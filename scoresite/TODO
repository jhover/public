TODO
====
* better cross-platform makefile support.
* better error handling, perhaps an option to check matrix validity
* possibly alter buffer usage to eliminate need for memmov calls--use a 
circular buffer?
* add support for a regulator template and paramters supplied on the command
line ala prosearch.
* add back support for printing surrounding sequence of a hit. 



LIMITATIONS
===========
To make it O(n) on sequence length, we read sequence file once for each 
regulator.
